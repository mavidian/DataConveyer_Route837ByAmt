# DataConveyer_Route837ByAmt

DataConveyer_Route837ByAmt is a console application to demonstrate routing capabilities of Data Conveyer.

The input file is expected to be a complete X12 interchange envelope that contains EDI 837 transactions, i.e.
medical claims. Each transaction is evaluated by Data Conveyer, specifically the CLM02 element ("claim
monetary amount") is examined and depending on whether it is below $1,000 or not, the transaction gets
routed to one of the 2 output files (_low or _high). Each of the 2 output file contains a complete, 
properly populated X12 interchange envelope.
